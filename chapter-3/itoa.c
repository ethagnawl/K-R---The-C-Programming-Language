// Exercise 3-4 explanation: There are a number of ways of representing signed
// integers in binary, for example, signed-magnitude, excess-M, one's complement
// and two's complement. We shall restrict our discussion to the latter two. In a
// one's complement number representation, the binary represenation of a negative
// number is simply the binary representation of its positive counterpart, with
// the sign of all the bits switched. For instance, with 8 bit variables:
//                  SIGNED BINARY  UNSIGNED
//
//                   25   00011001     25
//                  -25   11100110    230
//
//                   127   01111111    127
//                  -127   10000000    128
//
// The implications of this are (amongst others) that there are two ways of
// representing zero (all zero bits, and all one bits), that the maximum range for
// a signed 8-bit number is -127 to 127, and that negative numbers are biased by
// (2^n - 1) (i.e. -I is represented by (2^n - 1) - (+I).
// In our example, so:
//                Bias                 = 2^8 - 1 = 255 = 11111111
//                Subtract 25          = 00011001
//                Equals               = 11100110
//
// In a two's complement representation, negative numbers are biased by 2^n,
//         Bias = 2^8  = 100000000
//         Subtract 25 =  00011001
//         Equals      =  11100111
//
// In other words, to find the two's complement representation of a negative
// number, find the one's complement of it, and add one. The important thing to
// notice is that the range of an 8 bit variable using a two's complement
// representation is -128 to 127, as opposed to -127 to 127 using one's
// complement. Thus, the absolute value of the largest negative number cannot be
// represented (i.e. we cannot represent +128). Since the itoa() function in
// Chapter 3 handles negative numbers by reversing the sign of the number before
// processing, then adding a '-' to the string, passing the largest negative
// number will result it in being translated to itself:
//
//                  -128            : 11111111
//                  One's complement: 00000000
//                  Subtract 1      : 11111111
//
// Therefore, because (n /= 10) will be negative, the do-while loop will run once
// only, and will place in the string a '-', followed by a single character,
// (INT_MIN % 10 + '0'). We can remedy these two bugs in the following way:
//
// 1 - change 'while ((n /= 10) > 0)' to 'while (n /= 10)'. Since any fractional
// part is truncated with integer division, n will eventually equal zero after
// successive divides by 10, and 'n /= 10' will evaluate to false sooner or
// later.
//
// 2 - change 'n % 10 + '0'' to 'abs(n % 10) + '0'', to get the correct
// character.

void reverse(char s[]) {
    int c, i, j;
    for ( i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
        c = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = c;
    }
}

void itoa(int n, char s[]) {
    int i = 0,
        sign = n;

    do {
        s[i++] = abs(n % 10) + '0';
    } while (n /= 10);

    if (sign < 0) {
        s[i++] = '-';
    }

    s[i] = '\0';

    reverse(s);
}

int main() {
    int input = INT_MIN;
    char output[22] = "";
    itoa(input, output);
    printf("input (%d) => output (%s)\n", input, output);
    return 0;
}
